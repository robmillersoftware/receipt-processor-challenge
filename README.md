# Rob Miller's Solution to the receipt-processor-challenge
I wrote the solution in Go using mostly built-in libraries (other than Google's UUID library). I tried to keep the project as simple to build, run, read, and maintain as possible. I use comments heavily throughout the project to explain choices.

## To run
`go run main.go`

## To run tests
`go test ./...`
